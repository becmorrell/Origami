# Origami Examples

I wanted to share some of the Origami examples I have been practicing from the Origami website. 


## Instagram Photo Upload
Here is the Instagram photo upload example. I have added the following to practice patterns:

âœ… Tap and Long Press Interactions on the photo and video capture buttons
âœ… Multiple states - switching between album, photo and video screens using the tab bar or horizontal scrolling
âœ… Loops and loop select to display the selected image
âœ… Logic - and/or, greater than/less than, and equals exactly patches

Challenges ðŸ§ 
â€£ When animating the capture button on the video screen (see demo) I used stroke to display the progress. However, when you let go of the long press, the stroke would reverse instead of stopping immediately.
â€£ I had to create my own animation using a pulse, stopwatch and logic to define how long the progress is and the ability to reset it.
