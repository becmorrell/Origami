## My process

- I have used this design to practice adding the following:

    - Creating a reusable 'progress bar' component 
    - Looping the 'progress bar' based on number of groups to display
    - Used the `stopwatch` patch and logic to determine the progress of the active group

    - Used a counter to monitor how many items out of the loop have been completed 
    - Used an `option picker` to alternate between 0%, 100% and the live % progress

    - Used groups instead of screens to display each flow 
    - Used one option picker to present each group and one to start the animations on that particular group 
    - Added alot of `delay` and `transition` patches to start animating!

### What I learned ðŸ§ 

- Using a `progress` patch after a `progress` patch to speed up animations at a specific time point
- Using stroke to animate a mask of an image (giving the effect its being filled in - see group 6)
- Using the `option picker` to alternate between 0% progress (i.e the progress hasnt started yet), 100% (i.e that progress baris completed) and the live progress

This has been such a fun project to replicate! I couldnt find a simpler way to complete this with loops due to the groups being so different, therefore there is quite alot of repitition withn the prototype
