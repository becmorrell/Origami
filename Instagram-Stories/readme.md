# Instagram Stories

I've had great fun learning to use the camera patch in Origami to build something I use regularly! I got abit carried away and used the text field to make the prototype more interactive!

## My process

I started out with drawing the screens I wanted to display (camera, photo edit and video edit), then building the layers for each screen directly in Origami.

I have added the following:

âœ… `Camera patch`<br>
âœ… `Long press` interaction to record a video <br>
âœ… `Tap` interaction to capture a photo  <br>
âœ…  Link these into image and video layers to display <br>

âœ… `Loop Builder` used for creating a color picker by looping color components <br>
âœ… `Loop select` to change the background and text colors on photo edit screen <br>

âœ… Added a `text field` and lots of logic to begin and end editing it! <br>

## Challenges ðŸ§ 

This started out as a simple prototype to take a photo and video and display them on the screen. However, I got carried away with trying to replicate Instagram Stories! I've learnt alot during this process and loved playing around with the camera and video! 

â€£ I started out creating two different editing screens, one for a photo and one for a video. Long pressing the capture button would present the video edit screen and a tap would present the photo edit screen. However, I was duplicating the logic for adding text, so I condensed them into one edit screen with both the video and photo layers. 

â€£ Initially I used the capture button to both take a photo/video and present the edit screen, however the prototype was briefly displaying the old image/video prior to the new one, causing a flicker/jumping effect. I found `pulse on change` helpful in this situation. When the value in the camera patch changes (i.e a new photo or video is processed inside) a pulse is sent and then the screen can be displayed.
